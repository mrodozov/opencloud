# The use of Keycloak as bridge between OpenCloud and other identity providers creates more control over the
# authentication process, the allowed clients and the session management.
# Keycloak also manages the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) for OpenCloud.
# Keycloak can be used in two different modes:
# 1. Autoprovisioning: New are automatically created in openCloud when they log in for the first time.
# 2. Shared User Directory: Users are created in Keycloak and can be used in OpenCloud immediately
# because the LDAP server is connected to both Keycloak and OpenCloud.
